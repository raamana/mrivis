`mrivis` offers intuitive high-level classes for visualization of medical imaging data including:

 - advanced classes to easily develop customizable visualizations of 3D and 4D images, such as `Carpet()`, `SlicePicker()`, `Collage()` and the like
 - tools for comparison of spatial alignment of two 3D MRI scans (T1, T2, PET etc) using checkerboard plots and other comparison methods
 - additional helper, convenience and utility scripts related to visualization

Full documentation for both visualization classes and alignment check tools is available at https://raamana.github.io/mrivis/readme.html


A sample gallery of different ways to check alignment is shown below:
